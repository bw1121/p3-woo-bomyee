I had initially issues of animating and positioning elements correctly when animations were occuring. It took a bit of time to experiment with what would work.

I also used a mixture of JavaScript and jQuery as it was easier for me to read and work with (especially with delaying animations).

I also had some issues with responsivenss with animations. They were resolved by using percentages for positions and using CSS classes instead of changing CSS straight in the JavaScript file.
